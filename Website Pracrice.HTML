       <p>Stumble Guys is a multiplayer action game where you'll participate in fun battles against up to 32 players. You'll have to overcome all kinds of challenges in order to win. It's a title that takes all the best elements from the great Fall Guys to become one of its best clones that you can find on smartphones.

The colorful graphics in Stumble Guys will accompany you right from the start in this video game version of Takeshi's Castle. Each round is made up of three different challenges in which only a maximum number of players will classify. Your goal in each one is to avoid obstacles until you reach the finish line. This challenge won't be easy, but it will always make you smile: you'll face gigantic snowballs, falling platforms, revolving doors, wrecking balls, etc.

Playing Stumble Guys is simple thanks to its controls: a virtual joystick to move and the jump button. Not only will you use this button to overcome obstacles, but it'll also help you to move forward with momentum if you tap it again when you're in the air. The fun part of this peculiar battle royale doesn't end at its gameplay; you'll also have several avatars to use. You'll unlock skins with the gold you earn in the games you play.

Stumble Guys is a fantastic multiplayer game with a fun physics system and the excitement of playing against other players to win the coveted victory crown. All in all, it's a great Fall Guys clone to enjoy on your Android smartphone or tablet</p>
